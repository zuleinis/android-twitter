## Notes

Challenges: 
- At first, the get request to Twitter's API was getting a 403 response, which means there's an authorization issue. However, when I used the API keys that CodePath provided instead of my own, it worked.

## Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Android
